# Spaced Repetition Owl

Spaced Repetition Owl is an Android app built on the idea of “spaced repetition”, where in order to be able to learn or remember a subject properly, repeating the learning and memorization process on certain time intervals can be helpful. The app uses the time interval based on research by [Piotr Woźniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher)).

You can tell the app what you want to study or remember, and the app will keep track of when to do the repeat learning and remind you about it.

For the author personally, the app is also meant as an exploration of modern Android development techniques, which hopefully can be used as learning materials for others also. The app uses concepts and features such as:

- [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Material design](https://material.io/design/)
- [The Model-View-ViewModel pattern with Repository](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
- [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
- [Android Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation)
- [Android Notifications](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications)
